                <h3>An overlooked cause</h3>
                <p>When I worked on this project in October 2021, most of Europe had successfully fought off repeated
                    waves of the pandemic and had eased restrictions to the point where life started to feel like normal
                    again. Yet at that same point of time <strong>only 4% of Africans had received a vaccine
                        shot</strong>. The need for
                    action was undeniable, but as this case study will go some way to show, the awareness of this issue
                    was to some extent dulled by a growing fatigue towards the pandemic in the Western audience.

                    In 2021, the only way a private individual in Europe could make a direct financial contribution
                    towards the problem was through donations to the Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund, an organisation
                    that was for the most part unknown to a Western audience. If successful in increasing awareness of
                    the fund, this project could make a small, but still meaningful, difference.

                Survey
            </h3>
            <p>
                I was enrolled in college at the time and only had a couple of weeks to do the assignment, so fellow
                students were my most readily available source for user insights. I therefore based the project on
                <strong>20 -
                    30 year olds</strong> as the intended target audience for my campaign website.
                <br><br>
                I created a Google questionnaire with a view to capture their living situations, their news- and social
                media habits, their experiences with charitable giving and their attitudes to NGOs in general.

    <section class="case1__insights" id="insights">
        <div class="case1__insights__paragraph">
            <h3>
                Insights
            </h3>

            <p>
                When sorting through the responses I was pleasantly surprised to discover young people with dedication
                and generosity, who gave to charity even when student life meant living on limited budgets.
                <br><br>
                More challenging to this project however was their preferences when it came to NGOs. They expected the
                recipients of their donations to be personable organisations with a clear identity, a narrow focus, and
                represented by spokespeople or leaders with a strong presence in social media, ideally offering regular
                updates on their endeavours. <strong>They preferred smaller idealistic units to well-established
                    blue-chip
                    organisations â€“ passion and personal conviction over expertise and technocracy.</strong> Their
                amazing work
                notwithstanding, one could argue that the Covid-19 Solidarity Response does not match well with these
                expectations given their somewhat anonymous existence under the aegis of the WHO and other UN agencies.
                <br><br>
                Finally, I took some cues from Sara Wachter-Boettchâ€™s book 'Technically Wrong', and added a final
                section of questions about my recipientsâ€™ experiences (and possible trauma) related to the pandemic. I
                found that a third of my respondents preferred to avoid the topic altogether, and among the rest there
                were several who had experienced significant worries and even bouts of depression. Finding the right
                tone became crucial to the project.

                endeavours in a way that feels meaningful and relevant to 20 - 30 year olds, ultimately channelling as
                many of them as possible towards the fundâ€™s own donations page.

                In the pen and paper phase I was mindful of the target audienceâ€™s preference for mobile phones, so the
                layouts were sketched with a view to create a single, scrolling-friendly landing page. I divided the
                images and information into clearly defined and geometrically delineated sections that could easily be
                stacked and re-organised depending on the screen size.

            </h3>

            <p>
                I used the mid-fi wireframes as an opportunity to explore three distinct aesthetic styles. I conducted a
                series of user interviews, then returned with prototypes that could be tested with Figma and Figma
                Mirror.
                <br><br>
                Briefly explained, the first style attempted to represent the closest thematic link to the upbeat tone
                and saturated colours of social media, the medium through which one would most likely promote the cause
                to the target audience. The second option was based on the warm rich tones often associated with an
                African aesthetic, without making it too obvious, and the strong typographic contrasts reflect the
                visual language of news media from where the target audience received their updates on the pandemic. The
                final (and least popular) style sought to reflect the fight against the pandemic as a medical and
                scientific endeavour.
                <br><br>
                Given the seriousness of the subject matter my test users felt that the dark background and high
                contrast text of the second option created the right feel.

            <p>
                For all three themes I used Creative Commons licensed material from African photographers. I chose
                motifs featuring subjects in the same age bracket as the target audience, in relatable poses and
                fashionable clothes, thus <strong>carefully avoiding the many overused visual clichÃ©s applied to
                    Africa</strong> that one
                typically sees in NGO marketing material.
                Turning them into grayscale was a pragmatic decision, bringing visual cohesion to material shot by
                photographers with widely different styles and techniques.

                Given the above mentioned discrepancy between the target groupâ€™s ideals and the fundâ€™s public profile,
                getting the text right proved more challenging than I had expected.
                When writing I ended up relying heavily on my personas; Julie who prized immediate action and emotional
                involvement, Marte who expected to see quantifiable results, and Henrik who always preferred to focus on
                the situation on the ground rather than the NGO in question.
                The result was <strong>a text written with an emphasis on the second person singular</strong>,
                attempting to draw
                parallels between their own experience of the pandemic and that of their same age counterparts on the
                African continent. To loosen the dry feel of the factual information I posted a thread on Reddit
                soliciting stories about the pandemic from young African Reddit users and included a couple of their
                answers in the project.

                Much of the scrolling based dynamic on the page is made possible by creating CSS keyframe animations and
                then trigger them by various <strong>intersection observer</strong> functions written in Javascript.

                This project was my first chance to set up and implement various analytical tools. I get visitor
                statistics with Google Analytics and heatmap recordings with Hotjar. A great way to continue to gather
                user input once the initial insight and testing phases are over.
