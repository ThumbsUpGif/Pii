                    Brief
                </h3>

                <p>
                    I received the Oslo tourism app brief in August 2020, a time when Oslo was effectively closed to
                    foreign tourists and access to sites of interest was significantly restricted due to pandemic
                    guidelines. This left me with two possible directions. I could base the concept on usersâ€™
                    experiences before the pandemic, with a view to make an app that would become valid again a soon as
                    restrictions lifted. Or I could confine my research to the challenges of present moment and hope
                    that this extreme situation would create unique insights that could prove useful also when the
                    pandemic restrictions lifted.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I chose the latter, to make it <strong>a â€˜domestic tourist during a pandemicâ€™ project</strong>, and
                    set about
                    interviewing Oslo based friends, family, and colleagues over the phone, asking them about their
                    current urban leisure options. During much of 2020 this was essentially confined to going for walks
                    or hang out in parks and public squares.

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>
                Through research I discovered several sources of frustration across different demographics, but most
                interestingly <strong>I found that parents of young children could spend quite a bit of time searching
                    for
                    suitable playgrounds.</strong> As playgrounds can be owned and maintained by a wide range of
                different bodies;
                councils, housing associations, neighbourhood groups, schools and so on, there is no central registry in
                which they can be found, and more importantly from whom information about them can be comprehensively
                channelled to typical listing services such as Google or Four Square.
                That doesnâ€™t mean that playgrounds are impossible to find, after all there are plenty of them around,
                but itâ€™s difficult to know in advance if they are any <em>good</em>. According to my research, the best
                ways a
                parent could approach this matter would be to make a visual assessment from Google Mapsâ€™ satellite view
                or street view or, more commonly, network with other parents. This networking could be directly, through
                for example WhatsApp groups, or indirectly by searching online and discovering blog posts or social
                media comments.

                    <p>
                        This project seeks to help parents of young children by designing <strong>an app built upon a
                            map
                            indexed registry of good
                            playgrounds</strong> â€“ a registry that will be structured around the usersâ€™ needs. It aims
                        to
                        let parents
                        exchange experiences through a review and rating system and encourages them to enrich the
                        information available through submitting their own photographs. Lastly, I have added an
                        editorial
                        dimension, where articles and copy have the potential to enhance engagement as well as
                        potentially
                        opening avenues to monetize the project.

                    Following the research and concept development stages, the project moved to a pen and paper stage.
                    The first set of drawings were rather crude sketches of the appâ€™s main screens. These were then
                    loaded into the Marvel app for testing, allowing me to work out the most basic information flows and
                    seek out immediate user feedback.
                    <br><br>
                    For the second and third iterations of the project I moved the sketching routine to dot paper and
                    took care to consider the full length of the scrollable app screen.

                Where the concept and sketching phases had uncovered an abundance of ideas for what the app could be the
                lo-fi wireframes presented some harder decisions in terms of what categories of information would be
                given priority, in what order the information ought to be presented, and what should be cut out
                entirely.
                The first two iterations were user tested with the Adobe XD app, but by the third iteration the Figma
                Mirror app had improved to the point where it could support impromptu user testing using a phone only.

                    My initial concept was quick and straightforward, where the app would open directly in map view
                    allowing the user to immediately see which playgrounds were within walking distance from their
                    present location. However, most tourism and sightseeing apps are based on <strong>a central core of
                        editorialised content</strong>, allowing the user to plan their itineraries well in advance.
                    Later iterations
                    therefore explored the scope of what this content could be and how this could be made helpful to the
                    target demographic.

            <p>
                When working on the mid-fi wireframes I started using real data, while also playing around with various
                layouts and stylistic directions I had been wanting to try out. This introduced discipline to the
                process. The need to convey <strong>information from real playgrounds would regularly present challenges
                    to my
                    design ideas</strong>, compelling me to quickly throw out any sources of inspiration that could not
                be applied in
                practice.
                <br><br>
                Then followed a more intensive phase as I developed the feedback from the mid-fi wireframes into a hi-fi
                prototype with all relevant screens and functionality. Running frequent iterations, I tested the app on
                an ongoing basis with just a couple of dedicated users.
